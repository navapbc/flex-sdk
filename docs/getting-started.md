# Getting Started with Strata SDK

Welcome to the Strata SDK! This toolkit helps you build government digital services by providing a robust framework for creating application forms, managing cases, and implementing business processes.

## Your First Steps

When building a government digital service, the first thing you'll typically do is create an application form to implement the intake process. The Strata SDK provides all the tools you need to:

- Create user-friendly application forms
- Implement data validation and business rules
- Manage the application lifecycle from submission to processing

Ready to begin? Proceed to [Create an application form](./intake-application-forms.md) to start building your first form.

## Next Steps

After creating your application form, you can:

1. [Learn about the Strata attributes you can add to your form](./strata-attributes.md)
2. [Explore the Form Builder for rendering the form](./multi-page-form-builder.md)
3. [Create a case management business process](./docs/case-management-business-process.md)
