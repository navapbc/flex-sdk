# FlexSdk
Short description and motivation.

## Usage
In the dummy app, you can use classes defined in FlexSdk by calling them as follows:
`FlexSdk::ClassName.method_name(method_params)`

To test live in the dummy app, navigate to `test/dummy` and run `rails console`. From there, you can call any class within the engine using:
`FlexSdk::ClassName.method_name(method_params)`

ex: `FlexSdk::EligibilityEngine.evaluate({wages: 7000, hours_worked: 300}, {})`

## Installation
Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem "flex_sdk"
```

And then execute:
```bash
$ bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:
```bash
$ gem install flex_sdk
```
