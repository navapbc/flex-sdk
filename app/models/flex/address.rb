  # Address is a value object representing a physical address with street lines,
  # city, state, and zip code components.
  #
  # This class is used with AddressAttribute to provide structured address handling
  # in form models.
  #
  # @example Creating an address
  #   address = Flex::Address.new("123 Main St", "Apt 4B", "Anytown", "CA", "12345")
  #
  # Key features:
  # - Stores address components (street lines, city, state, zip)
  # - Provides comparison between address objects
  #
