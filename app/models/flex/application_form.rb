module Flex
  # ApplicationForm is the base class for all form models in the Flex SDK.
  # It provides functionality for tracking form status (in_progress/submitted)
  # and prevents modification of submitted forms.
  #
  # Form models should inherit from this class and add their specific fields.
  #
  # @example Creating a form model
  #   class MyApplicationForm < Flex::ApplicationForm
  #     attribute :name, :string
  #     attribute :email, :string
  #   end
  #
  # Key features:
  # - Tracks form status (in_progress/submitted)
  # - Prevents modification of submitted forms
  # - Publishes events when created and submitted
