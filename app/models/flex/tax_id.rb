module Flex
  # TaxId is a value object representing a tax identification number (e.g., SSN).
  # It inherits from String but adds formatting capabilities and validation.
  #
  # This class is used with TaxIdAttribute to provide structured tax ID handling
  # in form models.
  #
  # @example Creating a tax ID
  #   tax_id = Flex::TaxId.new("123456789")
  #   puts tax_id.formatted  # => "123-45-6789"
  #
  # Key features:
  # - Stores the raw digits of the tax ID
  # - Formats the tax ID with dashes (XXX-XX-XXXX)
  # - Provides comparison between tax ID objects
  #
  class TaxId < String
    include ActiveModel::Model
