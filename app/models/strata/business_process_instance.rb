module Strata
  # BusinessProcessInstance represents the runtime state and behavior of a business process
  # for a specific case. It manages the current step in the process flow and handles transitions
  # between steps based on events.
  #
  # This class acts as a bridge between the business process definition (BusinessProcess)
  # and the case it operates on. It maintains the current state and executes steps as
  # the process moves forward.
  #
  # @example Transitioning to the next step based on an event
  #   instance = case.business_process_instance
  #   instance.transition_to_next_step({ name: 'form_submitted', payload: { case_id: case.id } })
  #
  # Key features:
  # - Manages the current step in the business process for a specific case
  # - Handles transitions between steps based on events
  # - Executes the current step's logic (staff tasks, system processes, etc.)
  # - Closes the case when reaching the end step
  #
  # @see Strata::BusinessProcess
  # @see Strata::Case

    # BusinessProcessInstance is conceptually a value object associated with a Case.
    # Rather than having a separate table for business process instances, the data
    # (like current_step) is stored directly on the case table itself. This design
    # choice trades off logical separation for query performance by avoiding table joins.
    # An alternative implementation could store business process instance data in a
    # separate table, which would be logically cleaner but require joins during DB queries.
