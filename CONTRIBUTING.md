## üíª Getting Started with Local Development

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** - Required for running the local database
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)** - JavaScript runtime (LTS version recommended)
- **Ruby 3.4.2** - As specified in [`.ruby-version`](./.ruby-version)
- **Ruby Version Manager** (Required for most users): 
  - [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (recommended)
  - [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html)
  - [frum](https://github.com/TaKO8Ki/frum)
  - See [Comparison of ruby version managers](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/wiki/Comparison-of-version-managers) for more options

#### Installing Ruby 3.4.2

If you don't already have Ruby 3.4.2 installed, we recommend using rbenv:

1. Install rbenv and ruby-build (macOS with Homebrew):
   ```bash
   brew install rbenv ruby-build
   ```

2. Initialize rbenv in your shell:
   ```bash
   # For zsh (default on macOS)
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   source ~/.zshrc
   
   # For bash
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Install Ruby 3.4.2:
   ```bash
   rbenv install 3.4.2
   ```

4. Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   ruby --version  # Should show: ruby 3.4.2
   ```

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or your fork):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navapbc/strata-sdk.git
   cd strata-sdk
   ```

2. **Run the setup command** (this will install dependencies, create the `.env` file, and initialize the database):
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```

   This command will:
   - Install Ruby and Node.js dependencies
   - Create a `.env` file in `./spec/dummy/.env` based on the template at `./spec/dummy/local.env.example`
   - Start the Docker database container
   - Run database migrations and seed data

3. **Verify the setup** by running the test suite:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

### Development Commands

Here are the most commonly used commands for development:

- **Run tests**: `make test`
- **Run tests in watch mode**: `make test-watch` (automatically re-runs tests on file changes)
- **Run linter**: `make lint` (with auto-fixing)
- **Start dummy app server**: `make start` (for testing the SDK locally)
- **Database commands**:
  - Initialize database: `make init-db`
  - Reset database: `make db-reset`
  - Run migrations: `make db-migrate`
  - Rollback migration: `make db-rollback`
  - Access database console: `make db-console`

For a full list of available commands, run:
```bash
make help
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Port 5432 Already in Use

If you encounter an error during `make setup` about port 5432 being already allocated:

```
Error response from daemon: Bind for 0.0.0.0:5432 failed: port is already allocated
```

This means another PostgreSQL instance is using the default port. To fix this:

1. Check what's using port 5432:
   ```bash
   lsof -i :5432
   ```

2. Either stop the conflicting service, or change the port in `spec/dummy/.env`:
   ```bash
   # Edit spec/dummy/.env and change:
   DB_PORT=5432
   # to:
   DB_PORT=5433
   ```

3. Restart the setup:
   ```bash
   make init-db
   ```

## üîß Making Your First Contribution

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Navigate to [https://github.com/navapbc/strata-sdk](https://github.com/navapbc/strata-sdk)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top right corner
3. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account

### 2. Clone Your Fork

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/strata-sdk.git
cd strata-sdk
```

### 3. Set Up Upstream Remote

Add the original repository as an upstream remote to keep your fork in sync:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/navapbc/strata-sdk.git
```

### 4. Create a Branch

Create a new branch for your contribution:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` for new features
- `fix/` for bug fixes
- `docs/` for documentation updates
- `refactor/` for code refactoring

### 5. Make Your Changes

- Write your code
- Add or update tests as needed
- Update documentation if applicable
- Run tests and linter to ensure everything passes:
  ```bash
  make test
  make lint
  ```

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Write clear, descriptive commit messages:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of your change"
```

Good commit message examples:
- `Fix: Correct validation error in address form`
- `Add: Support for multi-language form labels`
- `Docs: Update installation instructions for macOS`
- `Refactor: Simplify business process state machine`

### 7. Keep Your Branch Updated

Regularly sync your branch with the upstream main branch:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

### 8. Push Your Changes

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

### Opening a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "Compare & pull request" button
3. Ensure the base repository is `navapbc/strata-sdk` and base branch is `main`
4. Fill out the PR template with:
   - **Clear title**: Summarize the change in one line
   - **Description**: Explain what changes you made and why
   - **Related issues**: Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")
   - **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
   - **Screenshots**: Include if applicable (UI changes)

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Writing Tests

All business logic should be thoroughly tested. When writing tests:

- Test multiple scenarios to ensure comprehensive coverage
- Consider creating data-driven tests for similar test cases with different inputs
- Use [Faker](https://github.com/faker-ruby/faker) to generate randomized test data
- Cover edge cases including:
  - `nil` inputs
  - Inputs that exceed expected length or size
  - Error scenarios and exception handling
  - Boundary conditions

See our [testing contribution guide](docs/contributing/testing.md) for more details.

### Code Style

- Follow Ruby community style guidelines
- Run `make lint` to check and auto-fix style issues
- Use descriptive variable and method names
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Add comments for complex logic

### Documentation

- Update relevant documentation when adding features
- Include code examples where helpful
- Keep README and guides up to date
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
