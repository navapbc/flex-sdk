# Leaving a project

When Ava leaves a project, we will need to remove access to the private flex SDK repository. In order for the client project to continue functioning the client will need to have a copy of the flex SDK locally.

## Steps

1. Copy a version of the flex SDK to a directory within the host application e.g. in `app/engines/flex`
2. Update the Gemfile to point to the local copy of the flex SDK instead of the GitHub repository:

   ```ruby
   gem "flex", path: "engines/flex"
   ```
