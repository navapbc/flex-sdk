Description:
    Generates view templates for Flex Cases with standardized layouts and commented variable replacement instructions.
    Creates index and/or show views based on specified view types.

Usage:
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case NAME [view_types] [options]

Examples:
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case PassportApplication
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case PassportApplication index
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case PassportApplication show
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case PassportApplication index show
    bin/rails generate flex:view:case BenefitsCase index show

Parameters:
    NAME: Required. The name for the case views (string with no whitespaces)
        Will be used to create the view directory at app/views/[name_underscored]
        Example: "PassportApplication" creates app/views/passport_application/

    view_types: Optional array of view types to generate
        Available options: "index", "show"
        Default: [] (no views generated)
        Example: index show

View Types:
    index: Creates an index view template for displaying lists of cases
        - Based on existing Flex case index patterns
        - Includes commented instructions for variable replacement
        - Creates app/views/[name_underscored]/index.html.erb

    show: Creates a show view template for displaying individual cases
        - Based on existing Flex case show patterns
        - Includes commented instructions for variable replacement
        - Creates app/views/[name_underscored]/show.html.erb

File Collision:
    The generator will check for existing files and abort with an error message if any target files already exist.
    This prevents accidental overwriting of existing view templates.

This will create:
    - View directory at app/views/[name_underscored]/
    - Index template (if "index" specified) with commented variable replacement instructions
    - Show template (if "show" specified) with commented variable replacement instructions
